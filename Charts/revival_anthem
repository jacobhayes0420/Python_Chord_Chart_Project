[Verse 1]
1                         2    6    4
Spirit fall down, Start a holy riot
1                              2       6     4
Fill this place now with the tongues of fire
1                                 2     6     4
Break the strongholds, Come and unleash heaven
1                        2       6
Burn within us, Make us bold as lions

[Chorus]
6            4       1
This is our revival anthem
6                  4        1
Can you feel the darkness shaking
6              4          1
Oh, we are the dry bones rising
2                 4    6
This will be our great awakening
2            4      1
This is our revival anthem

[Verse 2]
1                             2   6     4
Fill our hearts, Lord with a holy danger
1                   2      6      4
Lead us beyond our fear of failure
       1                             2         6      4
We’ll fight the good fight In Your strength and power
       1                    2         6
We’ll take back the night, victory is ours

[Bridge]
          1
We will praise You when our hearts are breaking
2
Praise You when our world is caving
6                          5sus
We will not, we will not be moved

         1
We will praise You till we see Your kingdom 
2
Greater things are surely coming
6                               5sus
You are God, and You are on the move
